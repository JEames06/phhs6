- Logic gates are combined to form transistors
- Transistors combine to form integrated circuits
- The integrated circuit is a silicon wafer that consists of various microelectronic components
- An integrated circuit is usually made of a single type of gate only

### Order

> Bidmas for logic gates


Order for gates:

- Brackets
- NOT
- XOR
- AND
- OR

**If you want to prioritise OR over AND then brackets are required.**

### Commutive Laws


- The order of the operands does not matter


### Associative Laws

- When all the operators are the same, it does not matter what order they are applied in.

### Simplifying boolean expressions

- Simplifying means rewriting the expression in a way that uses fewer logic gates but keeping the exact same functionality.

A+(-)A=1 - A OR NOT A IS TRUE
A+A=A
A.0 = 0
A.1 = A
A.A = A
A.(-)A=0
(-)(-)A=A

1) A
2) B
3) A.B
4) D.F+G+A.(-)B
5)
