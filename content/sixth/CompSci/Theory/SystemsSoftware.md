## Hardware vs Software

- The physical components of the computer are hardware.
- Programs that run on a computer are software.
- Software and hardware must be compatible with each other
- All components communicate using inputs and outputs

### System Software
- Responsible for hardware management
- Managing computer systems
- Window Management and Device Drivers

### Application Software
- Games, office tools, the things you use your computer for.

## Operating Systems

- Manage software **and** hardware
- Handles I/O from/to user
- Runs in the background
- Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS etc are all examples of operating systems.
- Acts as an interface between applications and physical hardwareâ€”usually providing APIs.

Operating System Functionalities:

- Memory Allocation (including SWAP)
- Window Management
- Kernel and Security of hardware access (including sandboxing)
- Process Management
- Hardware Management (device drivers, connectivity etc)
- Failure Handling & Recovery
- System Monitoring
- Disk Management (defragmentation, filesystems)
- User input handling, and output handling
- Provide baseline APIs for hardware and cross-software interactions
