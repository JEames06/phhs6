### What is it?

- A paradigm is simply the way you look at and make sense of the world

- So a programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and expressing a computer program.

- There are quite a few paradigms and some are related
	- Imperative: structured, procedural and object-oriented are examples
		- As a general rule, imperative languages explain how to do something step by step
	- Declarative: functional database (SQL) and mark-up languages (HTML)
		- As a rule, declarative languages describe the problem and the system knows how to deal with it
