### Buses

**Address Bus:** Transmits the address from the processor to the memory or I/O controller. Unidirectional: from the processor to memory and input-output devices.

**Data Bus:** Sends data between the processor, memory and input-output devices. It is bidirectional.

**Control bus:** Signals sent by the processor to control the memory and peripheral devices. Bidirectional: From the processor to the memory and input-output devices.
