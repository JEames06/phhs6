## Client-to-server network model

- Clients are computers that request information
- Servers are computers that provide information
- A client depends on the server for information

- For example, the client-side of a web application is a web browser. The web server provides the information.

### Types of servers

- Web servers
- Application servers
- Network Attached Storage (NAS)
- Print servers
- Mail servers

- etc

## Peer-to-peer model

- In a P2P network, each and every computer in a network is responsible for providing data equally.
- Each computer can provide data requested by other computers in the network.
- At the same time, any computer can request data from any computer.

- This type of network is not suitable for systems where there is a single source of truth (ie, databases, online ticketing systems etc)
- Due to a lack of servers, this type of network may lead to difficulty in storing backups.
- Known best for file sharing

## Cloud Computing

- The use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network such as the internet is called cloud computing. 
- A webpage displays these services to a client

### Traditional computing vs cloud computing

#### Traditional computing

- Files are stored in the hard drive of a computer and processed using the same computer.

#### Cloud computing

- Files are stored online and processed using services that are available online.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros

- More cost effective
- More reliable
- Can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. 
- Web applications are updated more frequently than traditional software.

#### Cons

- Requires an internet connection
- Working in online application may lead to cyber attacks
- Documents shared in web applications may be accessed by unauthorised users.

### Webpages

- A webpage is a document that can be viewed in web browsers.
