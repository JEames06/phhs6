- Technologies that allow users to transmit data from one point to another

## Serial Data Transmission

- Well suited for long distance communication, but the speed of the transmission is lower as there is only one channel used.
- There is no need for data synchronisation as bits are sent in one channel.
- USB is a common example

## Parallel data transmission

- Parallel transmission is faster than serial transmission as multiple channels are used.
- Used internally within a computer
- An internal timer synchronises the data on different channels
- 8-64 bit data buses are used

## Asynchronous data transmission

- In async data transmissions, the data is sent in groups in an agreed bit pattern. Bits are combined with a start and a stop bit.


## Synchronous data transmission

- A synchronous data transmission sends data as a stream of bits.
- The data also contains timing signals that are generated by an internal clock.



## Universal Serial Bus

- A USB device has four pins
- Two pins are responsible for connecting wires, which carry the power and ground connection
- The two other pins connect the wires that transfer data
- Hence te cable used to connect two USB ports is a four-wire shielded cable.
