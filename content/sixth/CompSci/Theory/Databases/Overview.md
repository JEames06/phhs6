## Data vs Information

### Data

- Values from a source where there is no context.
    - 16.7
    - True
    - Baker

### Information

- Values given context and therefore meaning.
    - Today's maximum temperature is 16.7 celcius
    - Are you passing your course? true
    - Customer's Last Name: Baker

Because of this, it would make more sense to describe a database as an "informationbase".
