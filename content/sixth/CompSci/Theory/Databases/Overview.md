## Data vs Information

### Data

- Values from a source where there is no context.
    - 16.7
    - True
    - Baker

### Information

- Values given context and therefore meaning.
    - Today's maximum temperature is 16.7 celcius
    - Are you passing your course? true
    - Customer's Last Name: Baker

Because of this, it would make more sense to describe a database as an "informationbase".


> Knowledge is power.



## What is a database?

- Put simply it is
    - persistent - it's not volatile
    - organised - we know where things are and where things go
    - information - it has context so we can make sense of it

## Why are databases used?

- Provide a centralised store for all of our information.
    - Making sure that all users can see the same data.
- Allow fast and accurate access to the information.
    - For analysis and reporting.
- Allow multi-user access.
    - From different locations and devices.
- Keep the data accurate.
    - Validating the inputs and only storing each piece of information once.
- Keeping the data secure.
    - Authenticating users and only showing them data they're allowed to see.

## Legalities

- The law says that data must be secure and accurate
    - Data Protection Act (DPA)
    - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- We must ensure that they stay accurate, not just because the law says so. 
    - If you move house, it is important that your bank knows this.
    - If I delete a supplier from my system, what about products that they sold us and that we sold onto our customers?
