## What is SQL?

- Structured Query Language
	- A fourth generation programming language
		- The programmer expresses the problem, not the solution

4th generation languages expect you to describe a problem, and the language will deal with finding the solution to solve the problem. Whereas 3rd generation languages require you to describe the solution to a problem.

## Terminology Changes

When you move from the design phase to the actual database phase, some terminology needs to be changed.

| Design Phase | Actual Database      |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Entity       | Table or relation    |
| Attribute    | Field or column      |
| Instance     | Record, tuple or row |

Any terminology not listed in the above table will stay the same regardless.
