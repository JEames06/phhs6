Graphs are used to represent data visually. They require relations between the data.

Circles or nodes are called vertices and the lines between them are called edges.

Larger graphs might look like this:

If an edge has a value associated with it, such as 6, then that edge is weighted. Typically, if one edge is weighted, you would expect all other edges to have a weight. You can describe a graph that includes weights, intuitively, as a weighted graph.

You can also represent data from a graph as an [adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix#Undirected_graphs)
