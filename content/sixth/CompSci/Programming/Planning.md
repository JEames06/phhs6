Taking time to think through what we intend to do will nearly always raise questions and usually helps you to understand the full scale of the problem that you are trying to solve.

## Methodologies

### Waterfall

Waterfall is flexible because you can go up or down the chain as needed. 

### Lifecycle/Agile

A large project may use multiple instances of the agile pan to work on subprojects. It's also possible to cycle around if an issue is found.

More subject to issues than Waterfall, as waterfall allows for queries to go back up the chain.

### Scrum

Continuous reviews of the project result in faster problem detection and resolution. Scrum immitates a much more natural working style.
