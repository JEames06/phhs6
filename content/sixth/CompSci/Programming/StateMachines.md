## Finite State Machines
 An FSM shows the states in which a system can exist, what causes the system to move from one state to another and what outputs or chages the transition causes.

The system must have a known (finite) number of states.

FSMs can be converted into a circuit, meaning that they can be used to control things such as traffic lights without the need for actual code.
