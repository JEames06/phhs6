## Finite State Machines
 An FSM shows the states in which a system can exist, what causes the system to move from one state to another and what outputs or chages the transition causes.

The system must have a known (finite) number of states.

FSMs can be converted into a circuit, meaning that they can be used to control things such as traffic lights without the need for actual code.

States are connected by transitions (arrows). Transitions should be labelled with the trigger for the transition.

They can be useful for debugging an algorithm or representing it in a way that people who don't work with code will be able to understand more easily. Start can be inidcated with an -> coming from nothing.
