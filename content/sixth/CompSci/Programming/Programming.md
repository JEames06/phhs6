Algorithms are instructions.

Computer process instructions.

Programming is the process of turning algorithms into instructions that can be followed by a computer.

Instructions are binary codes that represent the operations that the computer can perform.

So `0001` could be ADD and `0010` could be SHIFT.

Each type of computer has its own set of instructions - creatively called an instruction set, examples of these include x86 and ARM.

## Programming Languages

### 1st Generation
- Machine code
- Binary

### 2nd Generation
- Assembly code
- One-to-one equivalence to machine code
	- We would use a command word like `ADD` instead of a binary representation, because it is easier to remember

### 3rd Generation (or high level)
- High level languages are portable
	- They will run on different platforms (such as Linux x86 and Android ARM)
- They are natural-like
	- A single high level instruction (such as `print`) would turn into many low level instructions.
