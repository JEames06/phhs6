Algorithms are instructions.

Computer process instructions.

Programming is the process of turning algorithms into instructions that can be followed by a computer.

Instructions are binary codes that represent the operations that the computer can perform.

So `0001` could be ADD and `0010` could be SHIFT.

Each type of computer has its own set of instructions - creatively called an instruction set, examples of these include x86 and ARM.
