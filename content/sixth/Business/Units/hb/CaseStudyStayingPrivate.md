1) Timpson is a successful business with assets worth a lot of money. This makes them vulnerable to the impacts of having unlimited liability, as William Timpson and any other shareholders could be liable for any damages or debts that the company becomes involved in. Because of this, it makes logical sense for the business to move towards something with limited liability. This basic change in business form, whilst it would come with a few negative side effects, immediately protects the owners from a lot of risk. A private limited company would enable the company to fairly seamlessly transition without having to make too many adjustments to the functional structure of the organisation. Another option that might be viable for a company such as Timpson is a public limited company. This business form would bring increased scrutiny over the company, and would allow anybody to buy into the business—good for cashflow, not so great for control. 
	So whilst a sole trader isn't a completely unviable business form, it is definitely not a great idea. A private limited company is probably the best match for the business, as William Timpson said that he “would hate … having shareholders telling me what to do”, and a private limited company brings protection without letting anybody become a shareholder.
