## Measures of Quality

### Tangible

- reliability
- functions and features
- support levels and standards
- cost of ownership (repairs etc)

### Intangible

- brand image
- exclusiveness
- market reputation

## Importance of Quality

- Markets are **highly** competitive
- Customers are increasingly:
	- knowledgable and demanding
	- prepared to complain about poor quality
	- able to share information about poor quality via the internet
- If a business can develop a reputation for high quality then it may be able to create an advantage over its competitors.

Quality is every stage, not just the product. It includes:

- the buying process
- product reliability
- cost of ownership
- after-sales service

Just having a high quality product may not be enough. People won't be happy about the product if they have to wait 6 months for delivery, for instance.
