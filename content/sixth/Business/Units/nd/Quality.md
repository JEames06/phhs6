## Measures of Quality

### Tangible

- reliability
- functions and features
- support levels and standards
- cost of ownership (repairs etc)

### Intangible

- brand image
- exclusiveness
- market reputation

## Importance of Quality

- Markets are **highly** competitive
- Customers are increasingly:
	- knowledgable and demanding
	- prepared to complain about poor quality
	- able to share information about poor quality via the internet
- If a business can develop a reputation for high quality then it may be able to create an advantage over its competitors.

Quality is every stage, not just the product. It includes:

- the buying process
- product reliability
- cost of ownership
- after-sales service

Just having a high quality product may not be enough. People won't be happy about the product if they have to wait 6 months for delivery, for instance.

## Worksheet

Quality Control => Inspecting finished products for any faults and removing them
Quality assurance => An approach which recognises the contribution made by everyone in the organisation
Total Quality Management => Designing a process in such a way that defects do not happen
Quality Standards => A system of monitoring achievement in relation to certain targets.

### Not benefits of improving quality
- better skills for employees

### 3 ways in which better quality may help a business to be more profitable

1) Better reputation means more repeat customers and word of mouth marketing
2) Higher quality products will likely last longer, meaning that they may provide better value to customers than the competition
3) People are willing to pay a higher price for a quality product, meaning markups could be increased

### Briefly explain why a business might have an increase in the number of fault goods being returned

If a fault has occurred somewhere in the production process and has not been picked up by any quality management processes, then they may have batches of products that are faulty and do not meet the expectations of their customers. This may result in many customers being unsatisfied with the product and will likely lead to a spike in returns. 

It is also possible that an external factor to the production process may be causing issues, such as careless handling of the products in logistics, which could cause damage to perfectly fine units and require the business to replace them.
