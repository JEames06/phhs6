## Time based management

- Looks to reduce wasted time
- Faster development of new products
- Reduced lead times

Requires flexible, multi-skilled staff and the ability to change production at short notice. 

Time-based management focuses on optimising the usage of time to the greatest extent possible. 

### Simultaneous Engineering
- An element of time-based management, simultaneous engineering is a project management methodology. Instead of moving through the project in a linear way, all stages are handled simultaneously.
- Suppliers will be involved in the process as well, meaning that the final product can be produced much faster—and the time to market can be greatly reduced.

## JIT (Just in Time) production
- Products are produced on demand rather than in advance. 
- This process is much more vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.
- Costs are reduced, because less storage space and management of inventory is required.
- Lead times can be reduced, as products are not being produced in large batches or way in advance, so people could order products and have them in days rather than weeks or months.

## Cell Production

- A typical flow production line is split into many units (or cells). Each cell is responsible for one element of the finished product
- Cells tend to be isolated away from the main company—potentially being able to manage hiring and holidays internally.
- Cells interact with other cells as customers, meaning quality is ensured within the production line.
