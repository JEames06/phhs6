## To what extent did The Eden Project benefit from the time spent on its budgeting? (16 marks)

The Eden Project produced a large, detailed budget based on information that they had researched, allowing them to easily approach investors with a plan, showing what they were doing and how they planned to achieve it. Through this method, they managed to provide security to potential investors, ensuring that they are aware of the costs and where money was being allocated. Because of this, more money was given to The Eden project, ensuring the success of the scheme.

As they managed to ensure their budgeting was accurate, they reduced the budget variance, meaning that they didn't need to take drastic actions to ensure that they had enough money to complete the project.
