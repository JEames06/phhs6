A financial objective is a specific goal or target of relating to the financial performance, resources and structure of a business.

Typical financial objectives:

- Profit
- Cash flow
- Return on investment
- Capital structure
- Revenue
- Costs


3 profitability ratios:

- Gross profit margin
- Operating profit margin
- Profit for the year margin

If **gross profit** is positive, then it is still worth you producing a product or offering a service. It is making the business money to provide. If it is negative, then it is costing the business money to provide.

Gross profit is revenue from sales minus cost of sales

Operating profit is gross profit - expenses

And Profit for the year is operating profit - interest and taxation


Interest and taxation covers interest paid on debt or received plus tax payable of profit

gross profit margin = gross profit / sales revenue x 100
