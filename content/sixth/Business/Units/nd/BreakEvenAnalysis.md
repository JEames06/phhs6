Breakeven output (units) = Fixed costs (£) / Contribution per unit (£)

Contribution per unit = selling price per unit less variable cost per unit

Contribution per unit represents how much cash is contributed to the business for each unit sold. If the total contribution is greater than the fixed costs, then the business will make a profit.

- Contribution
	- Looks at the profit made on individual products
	- It is used in calculating how many items need to be sold to cover all the business's costs

Contribution has several formulae:

Total contribution = total sales less total variable costs
Contribution per unit = selling price per unit less variable costs per unit
Total contribution can also be calculated as = contribution per unit x number of units sold

Profit = Contribution less fixed costs
