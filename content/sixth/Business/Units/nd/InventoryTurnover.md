**Inventory turnover measures how often each year a business sells and replaces its inventory.**
*Bigger is better.*


### Main types of inventory

- Raw Materials & Components
- Work in progress
- Finished goods

### Calculating inventory turnover

Inventory Turnover = Cost of Sales / Inventories

So if cost of sales was £500,000 and inventories was £50,000 then inventory turnover would be 10 (times per year).

Cost of sales from income statement
Inventories from balance sheet

### Receivables 


Receivables (days) = Trade receivables / revenue (sales) x 365

### Payables

Payables (days) = Trade payables / cost of sales x 365
