**Inventory turnover measures how often each year a business sells and replaces its inventory.**
*Bigger is better.*


### Main types of inventory

- Raw Materials & Components
- Work in progress
- Finished goods

### Calculating inventory turnover

Inventory Turnover = Cost of Sales / Inventories

So if cost of sales was £500,000 and inventories was £50,000 then inventory turnover would be 10 (times per year).

Cost of sales from income statement
Inventories from balance sheet

### Receivables 


Receivables (days) = Trade receivables / revenue (sales) x 365

### Payables

Payables (days) = Trade payables / cost of sales x 365

### Evaluating inventory turnover

- Varies between industries
- Holding more inventory may improve customer service
- Seasonal fluctuations in demand during the year may not be reflected in the calculations
- Inventory turnover is not relevant to most service businesses

### How can inventory turnover be increased?

- Sell-off or dispose of slow-moving or obsolete inventory
- Introduce lean production techniques to reduce amounts of inventory held
- Rationalise the product range made or sold
- Negotiate “sale or return” arrangements with suppliers – so inventory can be returned if it does not sell

### Limitations of Ratio Analysis

- One data set is not enough
- Unknown reliability of data
	- Window dressing
- Based on the past
- Comparability

### Why might ratio data not be entirely reliable?

- Financial information involves making subjective judgements
- Different businesses have different accounting policies
- Potential for manipulation of accounting information (window dressing)

### What ratios don't show

- Competitive advantages (brand strength etc)
- Quality
- Ethical reputation
- Future prospects
- Changes in the external environment


### Ratios Summary

- Very useful analytical tools
- Widely used and understood
- Identify issues but don't solve problems
- Part of a range of indicators of business problems
