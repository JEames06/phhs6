A good supply chain should:
- meet needs and wants of customers
- be efficient

## Flexibility

- Flexibility is the ability to respond to change
	- To meet a sudden increase or decrease in demand
	- Change an aspect of the product to meet changing consumer tastes
	- Respond to erratic demand
		- Seasonality
		- Fashion
	- Flexibility can be improved through managing inventory and supply chain management
		- Good relationship with suppliers to respond quickly to changing needs
		- Just in time operations
		- Technology to quickly change re-order levels
	- A trend in increased flexibility is the ability of firms to use mass customisation
	- Mass customisation is the ability to tailor goods made in bulk to meet the requirements of individual customers

## Benefits and Difficulties of Mass Customisation


### Four types of mass customisation

- Collaborative Customisation
	- The business works closely with the customer to meet their precise needs
- Adaptive Customisation
	- A standardised product which can be customised or adjusted  by the customer.
- Transparent Customisation
	- This type of customisation occurs when unique products are produced for each customer but these are not identified as mass customised products.
- Cosmetic customisation - where standard products are produced but marketed to different customers in different ways.

### Benefits
