## Cash flow problems

- When a business does not have enough cash to pay its liabilities

### Common issues

- Sales prove lower than expected
	- Easy to be over-optimistic about sales potential
	- Market research may have had gaps
- Customers do not pay up on time
	- A notorious problem for businesses, particularly small ones
- Costs prove higher than expected
	- Perhaps because purchase prices turn out higher
	- Maybe also because the business is inefficient
- Imprudent cost assumptions
	- A common problem for a start-up
	- Unexpected costs always arise - often significant

### Causes of cash flow problems

- Too much capacity
- Excess inventories held
- Allowing customers too much credit and too long to pay
- Overtrading - growing business too fast
- Unexpected changes in the business
- Seasonal demand

### Terminologies

Suppliers:
- are creditors - you owe them
- payables

Customers:
- are debtors - they owe you
- receiveables

To optimise cash flow, a business will look to speed up payments from customers and slow down payments to suppliers.
