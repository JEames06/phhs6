**Authoritarian:** Absolute power to the boss, gives orders, does not delegate responsibility. Frequently used in highly regulated industries, low skilled jobs and areas where there is no time for debate (military, emergency services etc).

**Paternalistic:** Guides and helps subordinates and acts as a fatherly/motherly figure for people.

**Democratic:** Delegates most decision making to the group and doesn't directly order people to do much. Everything is fairly open and negotiable. Staff are typically highly skilled in jobs where this leadership style is employed.

**Laissez-faire:** Very little care is taken, employees are told what to do and left to get on with it.
