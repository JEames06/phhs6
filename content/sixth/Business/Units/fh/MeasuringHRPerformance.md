## Measurements

- Labour productivity
- Output per employee
-  Staff Turnover

### Employee retention

- All businesses loose staff
	- Natural causes (illness, death)
- Changes in strategy
	- Closing a branch
- Bad management or conditions
	- If people are unhappy with the conditions of the job they are more likely to leave

### Absenteeism

An employee's intentional or habitual absence from work.

- A significant business cost
	- Sickness costs around £600 for each worker per year

#### Formula

Number of staff absent during period 
/
Number employed during period

x 100

#### Alternative Formula

Number days taken off for unauthorised absence(during period)
/
Total days worked by workforce over the period

x 100

#### Worked example

Working days : 4000
Unauthorised Absence: 560

560/4000 x 100 = 14%
∴ Absenteeism = 14%
