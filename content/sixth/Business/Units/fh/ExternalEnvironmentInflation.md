**Inflation** is a sustained increase in the average price level of an economy.

- the rate of inflation is measured by the annual percentage change in the level of prices as measured by the consumer price index
- a sustained fall in the general price level is called deflationâ€”in this situation the rate of inflation becomes negative

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)


- the consumer price index is the mean measure of inflation for the UK
- the government has set the Bank of England a target for inflation  (using the CPI) of 2%
- the aim of this target is to achieve a sustained period of low and stable inflation
- low inflation is also known as price stability


### Two main causes of inflation

#### Demand pull

- when there is excess demand

#### Cost push

- when costs rise
