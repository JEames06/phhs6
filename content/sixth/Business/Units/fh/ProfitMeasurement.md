## Pricing considerations
Setting a price is very important, but can be difficult. The following need to be considered:

- Profit margins
- Costs involved
- Competition
- Target market
- Type of product
- *Inflation*
- Brand image
- Quality

### Revenue and Price

Revenue—total sales * price of product

A price must be high enough to cover costs and leave a surplus to provide a profit. Bad pricing can cost the business sales.

### Total Revenue

Total revenue can be described as:

- income
- revenue
- sales revenue
- sales turnover
- turnover

Total Revenue (TR) can be calculated by multiplying the average selling price (p) by the quantity sold (q).

## Types of costs

Some examples of costs include:

- packaging
- rent
- wages
- salaries
- distribution
- raw materials
- promotion
- machinery
- production
- running costs
- administrative costs

Overall, costs can be split into 2 categories -**variable** and **fixed**. A fixed cost does not change based on output, an example of fixed costs is salaries, rent and administrative costs.

Variable costs are costs that do change with output. Examples include raw materials, wages (if hours fluctuate or are piece rate), packaging etc.

**Fixed costs (FC) + Variable Costs (VC) = Total Costs (TC)**

**(Units sold * variable cost per unit) + fixed costs = Total Costs**

Average costs—how much it costs to produce a single unit or item.

Average cost per unit = Total costs / Total Output
