## Main methods of Industrial Action

- Strikes (last resort, refusing to work at all)
- Go slow (employees deliberately slow down to damage productivity)
- Work To Rule (works at the minimum level set out by contract)
- Overtime ban (Can have a significant effect on production capacity during peak periods, as nobody will work any extra hours)

## Who suffers from industrial action?

### Business

- Loss of sales
- Damage to customer satisfaction
- An internal distraction for management

### Employees

- Lost pay
- Potential loss of jobs
- Possible loss of customer and public support
- Risk that illegal action will result in legal proceedings

## Avoiding Industrial Disputes

- Regular consultations with trade unions
	- Pick up problems before they escalate
- A staff forum or joint working group to pass on information and collect ideas from workers and consult with workers
- An employee consultative body to discuss major issues as they arise
- Team and group meetings and feedback sessions

- Regular communication and honest discussion is important

### Works Councils

- A group of people from management and the workforce that meet to discuss company-wide issues.
- Complementary to the role of trade unions, not a replacement
- Struggles to perform tasks such as bargaining over wages

## Settling disputes using ACAS

- Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service
	- Conciliation
	- Mediation
	- Arbitration

### Mediation

- Two or more individuals or groups reach a solution that's acceptable to everyone
- Involves an independent/impartial party

### Conciliation

- Used when an employee is making or could make a specific complaint against their employer to an employment tribunal
- Conciliator has no authority 
- Both parties work together to try and prevent the need to go to an employment tribunal

### Arbitration

- An alternative to a court of law
- Held in private rather than in public
- An impartial outsider being asked to make a decision on a dispute
- Arbitrator makes a firm decision on a case based on the evidence presented by both sides
- Arbitration is voluntary, so both sides must agree that they will attend it, and that they will respect the decision of the arbitrator
