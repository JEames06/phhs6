Marketing is **the process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer needs profitably.**

Objectives are **statements of specific outcomes that are to be achieved**.

Marketing objectives must be consistent with corporate objectives. 

For example, if the corporate objective is to reach a market share of 10%, the marketing objectives may be to reach sales of Â£100 per customer.

When you set an objective, it provides a focus and a purpose to the people involved.

## Marketing Maths

Key measures:
- Market Size
- Market Growth
- Market Share

### Market Size

The total size of the market, the number of sales in the specific industry (ie, how many smartphones are sold).

Usually measured in either **volume** or **sales (revenue)**.

Not usually a marketing objective, as you can't easily influence in the size of a market.

Market segments can also be measured.
