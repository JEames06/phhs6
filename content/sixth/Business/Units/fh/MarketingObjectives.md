Marketing is **the process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer needs profitably.**

Objectives are **statements of specific outcomes that are to be achieved**.

Marketing objectives must be consistent with corporate objectives. 

For example, if the corporate objective is to reach a market share of 10%, the marketing objectives may be to reach sales of £100 per customer.

When you set an objective, it provides a focus and a purpose to the people involved.

## Marketing Maths

Key measures:
- Market Size
- Market Growth
- Market Share

### Market Size

The total size of the market, the number of sales in the specific industry (ie, how many smartphones are sold).

Usually measured in either **volume** or **sales (revenue)**.

Not usually a marketing objective, as you can't easily influence in the size of a market.

Market segments can also be measured.

| Year | Market Size (£) | Index Number (2014 = 100) |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 2014 | 5000000         | 100                       |
| 2015 | 5250000         | 105                       |
| 2016 | 5600000         | 112                       |
| 2017 | 6250000         | 125                       |


### Market Growth

- A key indicator for existing and potential market entrants
- Growth rate can be calculated using either value (eg market sales) or volume (units sold)

| Year | Units Sold [A] | Change (Units) [B] | Growth Rate (%) [B/A (from prev yr] x 100 |
|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2014 | 1000000        | -                  | -                                         |
| 2015 | 1100000        | 100000             | 10.0                                        |
| 2016 | 1350000        | 250000             | 22.7                                      |
| 2017 | 1475000        | 125000             | 9.3                                       |


### Market Share

- Explains how the overall market is split between the existing competitors
- Tends to be calculated based on market value, but volume can also be used
- Good indicator of competitive advantage
- Key is to look for significant increases or decreases in this value

| Business | Sales in 2018 (£) | Cumulative Market Sales (£) | Market Share (%) in 2018 |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| A        | 250000            | 250000                      | 12.5                     |
| B        | 400000            | 650000                      | 20                       |
| C        | 900000            | 1550000                     | 45                       |
| D        | 175000            | 1725000                     | 8.75                     |
| E        | 275000            | 2000000                     | 13.75                    |

## Problems with setting market objectives

- Fast-changing external environment
	- new competitors or legislature
- Potential conflict between marketing objectives
	- trying to increase market share by cutting prices may damage brand perception
- Easy to be too ambitious with marketing objectives
	- growing market share without putting necessary resources in place to achieve it

### Example of marketing objectives

**Maintaining or increasing market share** (corporate objective) => Achieve revenue growth of 20% per year for the next four years. Increase our market share in the Uk by 5% by 2017. Add 1,000 new customer accounts generating at least £100,000 per account within four years. (marketing objective)
