- Job design is all about the tasks and responsibilities that are grouped into a specific job.
- Job design can have a significant influence on labour productivity through the link with motivation.
- Boring, repetitive jobs can often lead to poor quality and low productivity.

- Job design aims to improve motivation and job satisfaction and a sense of personal achievement by reducing mechanistic or repetitive tasks.
- Through job design or redesign an organisation aims to reduce labour costs (eg through absenteeism, labour turnover) and improve labour productivity without offering additional monetary reward.

## Job Enrichment and Job Enlargement

- Job Enrichment
	- Giving workers more interesting and challenging tasks
	- Seen as more motivating as it gives workers a chance to further themselves
	- Herzberg in particular recommended this approach
- Job Enlargement
	- Giving workers more tasks to do of a similar nature or complexity
	- Job rotation is a part of this

## Influences on Job Design

- Productivity
- Maintaining/improving quality
- Motivated staff
- Retention of staff
- Absenteeism

## Hackman and Oldham—Job Characteristics Model

- Employees will work much harder and better when they are rewarded for the work they do and when that work provides them with satisfaction. They will perform even better when they can see the relevance of the tasks.


- Based on the belief that the **task itself is key** to motivation.
	- Skill variety ⇾ The more variation in tasks and their required skills, the more engagement will be gained from employees
	- Task Identity ⇾ A clear beginning and end to the task, with a clear overall description of the ask.
	- Task Significance ⇾ Whether the job or task has a significant impact-either to the individual, the business, or society overall. If the job is important, then it has meaning, so it is more engaging to the employee.
	- Autonomy ⇾ How much freedom is given to an individual to accomplish their tasks. What freedoms are they given over how they complete the task, when they complete the task and what decisions they can make.
	- Job Feedback ⇾ Employees are kept in the loop when it comes to their performance. They are told whether they are doing their job well, and if they are not, they are given constructive criticism on how they can improve.
