2) The physical environment that Ryanair provides are cut right back to reduce the costs on Ryanair. Whilst this does offer customers very competitive prices. Many customers will expect additional service to be provided, however Ryanair either does not provide these at all or uses them as an opportunity to charge an additional fee.

3) Digital marketing is any marketing that takes place digitally, typically online. This could be anything from social media advertising campaigns to viral videos.  It allows for very rapid, certain marketing. Online people can find and share content much more quickly leading to greatly improved marketing performance. And if an advertising campaign is purchased via a technology company they can typically gaurantee so much reach and interactions. 

4) Ryanair achieves penetration pricing partly via their dynamic pricing model, where they will sell the first tickets on a flight at very low prices, and gradually increase the price as more seats fill up. They also provide seasonal offers, where even lower prices are offered (and advertised) allowing for them to appeal to the market as **the** choice for cheap air travel. The impact of penetration pricing is typically stiffling competition and increasing units sold.

5) After Ryanair has sold the first 70% of seats on a flight, they switch from their lower pricing strategy to a price skimming strategy. Ryanair knows that if you have not booked in the first 70%, then you are likely to be somewhat desperate to get a flight, meaning that you will be more likely to pay a higher price, because you just need a flight and don't have the flexibility to choose another flight. Therefore, Ryanair has successfully implemented price skimming across the final 30% of ticket sales for each flight, allowing them to make more money from these customers whilst still typically managing to fill the flight - and give most customers the impression of great prices.

6) Ryanair became established and scuessful fairly quickly in Europe, and already had a fairly large market share. There is not enough room for two businesses to exist in the very low end flight market. So if SouthWest Airlines moved into Europe, they would have a very high risk, low chance of success battle to beat Ryanair in the market. This is not something that their low cost model would work well with, as it would likely lead to increasing prices in the main American branch.
