## Market Conditions: Two Key Indicators

**Economic Growth (GDP):** The level of demand in most markets is influenced by the rate of economic growth. Economies vary in terms of their "normal" long-term growth rate. A mature economy like the UK has a long-term growth rate around 2-3%. It shouldn't be too high, or too low. GDP growth will vary depending on the state of the economic cycle.

GDP = Gross Domestic Product

The value of goods and services produced by an economy over a specific period.

GDP:

- measure of the value of activity of economy
- value used to assess changes in economic growth

Demand:

- how much of a good or service a consumer wants - and is able to pay for 
- for a business, demand turns into revenues (sales)
