## Explain two methods of employee representation introduced at Educsupplies (6 marks)

Educsupplies introduced a suggestion scheme, allowing employees to provide feedback about the running of the business and their views. The “you said – we did” initiative allowed employees to view the impact of their feedback and gain a sense of importance. 

Equally, the director's walkabout enabled direct and instant communication between employees and directors, meaning that the day-to-day issues of an employee could be quickly and clearly communicated to someone from the board. This will lead to many issues being raised with the highest level of management before they have time to develop into something that will lead to dissatisfaction and possible grievances. 


## Most employees at Educsupplies belong to the recognised trade union. Explain two possible benefits to employees of belonging to a trade union. (6 marks)

By being a member of a union, employees will benefit from improved negotiations over the likes of pay and working conditions thanks to the collective bargaining that a union can perform. This has already lead to improvements in the mentioned areas for employees, which will help to keep them satisfied with their jobs, leading to lower labour turnover and greater productivity. The union also provides employees with an additional layer of protection or a safety net of sorts, allowing them to feel more comfortable and protected whilst at work. Because of this, employees will have a less stressful working experience, because should something bad happen, they will have a strong organisation to fall back on.
