### Porter's Five Forces
- Devised by Michael Porter
- A framework for analysing the nature of competition within an industry

### Summary for industry profits


#### High industry profits associated with

- Weak suppliers
- Weak customers (buyers)
- High entry barriers
- Few opportunities for substitutes
- Little rivalry

#### Low industry profits associated with

- Strong suppliers
- Strong customers (buyers)
- Low entry barriers
- Many opportunities for substitutes

### The five forces

- Threat of new entrants to a market
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Threats of Substitute Products
- Bargaining power of buyers (customers)
- Intensity of rivalry within the industry

#### Threat of new entrants

- If new entrants move into an industry they will gain market share and rivalry will intensify
- The position of existing firms is stronger if there are barriers to entering the market
- If barriers to entry are low then the threat of new entrants will be high, and vice versa.

#### Barriers to entry

- Investment cost
- Economies of scale available to existing firms
- Regulatory or legal restrictions
- Existing products with a strong brand of USP
- Access to suppliers and distribution channels
- Retaliation by established products (price war)

#### Bargaining power of suppliers

- If a firm's suppliers have bargaining power they will:
	- Exercise that power
	- Sell their products at a higher price
	- Squeeze industry profits
- If the supplier forces up the price paid for inputs, profits will be reduced
- The more power the customer (buyer) the lower the price
