## What is meant by the term "target market"? (2m)

The target market is the selection of people that the business wishes to sell their products to. They try to tailor their offerings to that demographic.

## State two examples of behavioural segmentation included in the article (2m)

- Celebrity purchases are noted on the website, so people who like to follow celebrities will be more likely to buy from Lush.
- They also focus heavily on freshness and authenticity of their products, meaning that people who look for quality will be more attracted to their store.

## Analyse two reasons why Lush introduces new products every three months. (9m)

Customers come to Lush because their products are *fresh*, if they offered the same products constantly then the range would become stale. This would psychologically impact the customers, making them feel that Lush wasn't being fully fresh. By using fresh ingredients and changing their range up frequently, they can counter this.

Also, fresh ingredients means that products have a short shelf life otherwise they would risk damaging their reputation. This would result in them having to have a short production chain and a quick product turnover in their stores. Therefore, changing their actual products helps to keep things fresh without having much of an impact on their production.

Lush is “iconic”, their stores are unlike any others. You can smell their stores from a distance, which makes them noticeable. If Lush sold their products in other company's stores such as a supermarket, they would not be able to utilise such a marketing method. Also, people tend to consider the ethics of the store they are in more tha the ethics of the company producing the product that they asre buying.
