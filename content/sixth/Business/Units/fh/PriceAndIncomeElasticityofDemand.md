**Elasticity** measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in a relevant variable—such as price or income.

**Price elasticity of demand**—measures the extent to which the quantity of a product demanded is affected by a change in price.

Price Elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated using:

**% change in quantity demanded / % change in price**


Price elastic=> PED is greater than 1 => Change in demand is more than the change in price

Price inelastic => PED is less than 1 => Change in demand is less than the change in price

Unitary price elasticity => PED is exactly 1 => Change in demand = change in price.

If PED greater than 1, a change in price will cause a larger change in demand, so overall revenues would increase with a price cut, but drop with a price increase.

## Factors influencing PED

- Price of complementary goods
- Brand strength
- Habit
- Availability of substitutes
- Time
