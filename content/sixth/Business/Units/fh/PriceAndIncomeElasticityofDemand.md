**Elasticity** measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in a relevant variable—such as price or income.

**Price elasticity of demand**—measures the extent to which the quantity of a product demanded is affected by a change in price.

Price Elasticity of demand (PED) is calculated using:

**% change in quantity demanded / % change in price**


Price elastic=> PED is greater than 1 => Change in demand is more than the change in price

Price inelastic => PED is less than 1 => Change in demand is less than the change in price

Unitary price elasticity => PED is exactly 1 => Change in demand = change in price.

If PED greater than 1, a change in price will cause a larger change in demand, so overall revenues would increase with a price cut, but drop with a price increase.

### Factors influencing PED

- Price of complementary goods
- Brand strength
- Habit
- Availability of substitutes
- Time

**Income elasticity of demand**-measures the extent to which the quantity of a product demanded is altered by a change in income.

Calculating income elasticity of demand (YED) is done using the formula:

**% change in Quantity Demanded / % change in income**

Typically:
- a rise in income will result in a rise in demand
- a fall in income will result in a fall in demand
To the extent:
- this depends on the type of product (necessity vs luxury)

For inferior goods, demand falls as income rises, but increases as income declines.
 
PED: A(-1.5), B(-0.2)
IED: A(0.5), B(-1.9)
*Negatives can be ignored here*

PED: A is elastic, B is inelastic
Y/IED: B is luxury(elastic), A is necessary (inelastic)
