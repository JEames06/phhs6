**Real incomes** measure the amount of disposable income available to consumers (eg, households & individuals).

### Factors impacting real incomes:

- inflation
- wage growth
- employment levels
- interest rates
- tax policies


Household income is only one factor that impacts consumer spending.

### Impacts of lower interest rates

- Costs of servicing loans / debt is reduced—boosting spending power
-  Consumer confidence should increase leading to more spending
- Effective disposable income rises—lower mortgage costs
- Business investment should be boosted eg, prospect of rising demand.
- Housing market effects - more demand and higher property prices
- Exchange rate and exports - cheaper currency will increase exports
