### Mayo

### Peters

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

- Five levels of human needs which employees need to have fulfilled at work
- Only once a lower level of need has been fully met, a worker would be motivated by the opportunity of having the next need up in the hierarchy satisfied
- A business should therefore offer different incentives to workers in order to help them fulfil each need in turn and progress up the hierarchy

## Taylor's Scientific Management Activity Worksheet

- Frederick Winslow Taylor 
- Taylorism
- Motivated by pay
- Science can be used to increase efficiency
- Workers given one task to master
- “In the past, the man has been first. In the future, the system must be first.”
- “One best way” to do a task
- Managers maintain close control and supervision


### Key concepts of scientific management theory

- Standardised approach to optimising work for a more efficient workforce
- Time and motion study analysing tasks & finding the quickest way of completing tasks
- Workers did not have to be skilled just highly productive at one job
- After finding the “one best way” employees then need to be motivated to work in that way
- This could be done by increased pay for productive workers & firing ineffective workers → Piece rate pay


## Taylor's Approach to Management

### Work Study

- Identify the most efficient methods of production

### Identify

- Spot the most efficient worker and identify why they are so good

### Train

- Train the remaining workers to work like the best

### Reward

- Pay workers based on productivity (ie, piece rate)
