## Human Resource Flow ##

the flow of employees through an organisation 
including:
- the inflow - when they are recruited
- the internal flow - what happens to them within the organisation
- the outflow - when they eventually leave the organisation

* The Inflow *

Involves decisions about recruitment, selection and induction of new employees

*The Internal Flow *

Involves decisions about transfers, redeployment, promotions and demotions, training and development, evaluating employees' performance and rewarding them.
The internal flow must be managed to ensure employees' skills and competencies are developed to meet organisational needs, while at the same time satusfying 
employees' own career aspirations.

* The Outflow *

Involves decisions about when and how employees leave an organisation, including retirement, redundancy and dismissal.

# Human Resource Plan #

- forecasting labour demand
- analysing present labour supply
- balancing projected labout demand and supply

* STages in HRP *

1) assessing hte current workforce
2) assessing the workforce needed in the future
3) identifying the gaps or areas of oversupply
4) developing strategies to fill gaps or reduce the oversupply
5) right people, right place, right time
