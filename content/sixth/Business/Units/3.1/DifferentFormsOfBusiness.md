## Business Research: Public Limited Companies

A plc tends to be a fairly established business, as it costs Â£50,000 to set up (at least) and therefore it is usually a reformed private limited company. Like a private limited company, plcs are owned by shareholders. However, there is a fundamental difference - as the shares of a public company are traded on the stock exchange and can be bought by anyone. This enables the raising of stock capital.

There are also more high level requirements placed on the business, as more documents must be published - including public accounts.

This means that anyone can own part of the business if they purchase shares. However, the effective owner of the business is the majority shareholder - if there is one. 

Decisions will be made by the executive employees (such as the CEO) and the board (made up of major shareholders). This only covers major decisions, as more minor decisions will still be covered by lower levels of management.

Hostile takeovers are a higher risk for public limited companies as anybody is capable of purchasing shares. The setup cost is high, and shareholders will all expect a cut of the profits.

The shareholders all have limited liability.

A plc is usually a lot bigger than a standard ltd company.
