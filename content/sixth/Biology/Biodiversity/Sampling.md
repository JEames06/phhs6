- We use sampling to gain insight into organisms in an area. Sampling is taking measurements of a limited number of organisms present within an area.
- Random sampling is selecting individuals by chance.
- You can perform random sampling by:
	- marking a grid on the surface
	- using random numbers to determine x and y coordinates
	- taking a sample at each coordinate pair

- Non-random sampling
	- Opportunistic—the weakest option. Uses organisms that are conveniently available 
	- Stratified—some populations can be divided into strata based on specific characteristics such as gender
- Sampling can never be entirely representative because you never measure the whole population. There is sampling bias, which may be deliberate or accidental. This can be reduced by using random sampling.
- Chance based reliability issues cannot be mitigated, as they arise from chance alone. It is simply possible more snails will be present on one day by chance.

### Plant Sampling

- Generally involves a quadrat

- Visual survey: generates quantitative data
- Estimate abundance using ACFOR scale
	- A—abundant
	- C—common
	- F—frequent
	- O—occasional
	- R—rare
- Density = mean number of individuals per unit area
