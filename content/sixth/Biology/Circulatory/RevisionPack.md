## Order of cardiac cycle

Event -> Immediately followed by

Atrial walls start to relax -> ventricle walls start to contract

Sinoatrial node generates electrical signals -> electrical signals transmitted down septum

Atrioventricular node receives electrical signals from SA node -> Ventricle walls start to contract

Ventricle walls start to contract -> Walls of atria contract

Ventricle walls relax -> atrioventricular valves open

## Tachycardic ECG trace

## Effect of tachycardia on blood flow from heart

- More blood will exit the heart over any specific period of time
- Blood pressure will be elevated due to more rapid movement
- Each pump of the heart will move slightly less blood than normal because the heart does not have sufficient time to fill.
