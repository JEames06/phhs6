This site hosts various work I do openly, with the intention of creating an easily accessible, free knowledgebase. Although please do keep in mind that this site is primarily intended for my personal use.

My biology work is not done here primarily, so it is copied up after being done in batches. This may result in significant delays.

Content on this site may not all be owned or produced by me, and is hosted here under fair use. If you have the rights to any content here and wish to have it altered or removed, then please contact me to request this.

The accuracy of the information on the site cannot be fully guaranteed. I do my best but as I am learning these subjects some inaccuracies are inevitable. If you notice something, please let me know or submit a correction on GitHub. I will appreciate any feedback.
