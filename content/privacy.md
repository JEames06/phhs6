> This website is built as a hobby project - it is intended mainly for personal use and is provided publicly free of charge. I go out of my way to try and reduce data gathered, keeping things fairly minimal, but due to the use of third-party tools I cannot guarantee this.

**What data we collect**

No client side tracking is present on this site. Some analytics are collected by the webserver and some by Cloudflare.


Whilst the source code for the site is hosted on GitHub and the static site is built by GitHub Actions, it is not hosted by GitHub. I am privately hosting the site with [Frantech Solutions](https://frantech.ca), who are strongly committed to privacy.

DNS records are created and managed via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and we do use Cloudflare as a proxy for this service. 

**I am open to any questions or discussions regarding this policy and any changes you might want to see. Please make these via [my community site](https://community.sethmb.xyz)**

> [!success] Corporate affiliation
