**What data we collect**

*Umami* is used to collect basic analytical data on site visitors - this data is used solely for optimising the website. No personally identifiable data is collected.

Here is a statement from Umami's website:

**Is Umami GDPR compliant?**

> Yes, Umami does not collect any personally identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected. Users cannot be identified and are never tracked across websites.

For clarification, we host our own Umami instance - so no third-party has access to this data.

Umami does not use cookies.

We host the site on **GitHub Pages**, using their default settings. This means some information about you and your browser will be provided to GitHub - their privacy policy can be found here: [GitHub privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)
