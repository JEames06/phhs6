**What data we collect**

*Matamo* is used to collect basic analytical data on site visitorsâ€”this data is used solely for optimising the website. No personally identifiable data is collected. This is set to respect Do Not Track requests from your browser, so enabling Do Not Track will automatically opt you out of data collection. You are also welcome to block scripts from *me.sethmb.xyz/analytics* from being loaded should you wish to ensure no communication occurs.


Whilst the source code for the site is hosted on GitHub and the static site is built by GitHub Actions, it is not hosted by GitHub. I am privately hosting the site with [Frantech Solutions](https://frantech.ca), who are strongly committed to privacy.

DNS records are created and managed via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and we do use Cloudflare as a proxy for this service. 

**I am open to any questions or discussions regarding this policy and any changes you might want to see. Please make these via [my community site](https://community.sethmb.xyz)**
