An example process of how organelles in a cell would work together to produce insulin would be:</description></item><item><title>Light Microscopy</title><link>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Cells/LightMicroscopy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Cells/LightMicroscopy/</guid><description>Maximum resolution: 200nm
Any objects closer than 200nm will appear as one object under the best light microscope.
2 objects can only be seen if light is able to pass between them.</description></item><item><title>Organelles</title><link>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Cells/Organelles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Cells/Organelles/</guid><description>![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/Pasted image 20220908112443.png]]

Staining Many biological materials are not coloured Some chemicals can bind to a specimen, giving it a colour It produces a contrast between sample parts Some stains are specific to cell structures, enabling for easily distinguishing between different cell parts.</description></item></channel></rss>
