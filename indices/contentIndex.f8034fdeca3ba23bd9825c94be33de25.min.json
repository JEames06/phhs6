The distinguishing factor between rough and smooth ER is that rough ER is coated with ribosomes.\n\nRER is the cells internal transport system and creates channels that enable the transport of substances from one section of the cell to another. The RER provides a large surface area for ribosomes to attach. The ribosomes assemble proteins from amino acids , these proteins are then absorbed through the membrane and are transported by the RER to the Golgi Apparatus for modification and packaging. \n\n## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER/Smooth ER)\nLike the RER, this is a system of membrances within the cell that contain fluid-filled cavities that link to the nuclear envelope. It DOES NOT have ribosomes on its surface.\n\nSER contains enzymes that catalyse reactions involved with the metabolism of lipids. This includes: \n\n- synthesis of cholesterol\n- synthesis of lipids/phospholids needed by the cell\n- synthesis of steroid hormones\n\nIt is involved with the absorption, synthesis and transport of lipids from the gut.\n\n## Golgi Apparatus\nThis consist of a stack of membrane bound flattened sacs. Secretory vesicles bring materials to  and from the Golgi. \n\nProteins are modified here. Examples include:\n\n- adding sugar molecules to make glycoproteins\n- adding lipid molecules to make lipoproteins\n- folding proteins into their 3D shape\n\nThese proteins are then packaged into vesicles that are pinched off and then:\n\n- stored in the cell\n- moved to the plasma membrane, either to be incorporated into the plasma membrane or to be exported out of the cell.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nThese are usually spherical, rod-shaped or branched structures and are typically 2-5Œºm long. They are enclosed in two membranes with a fluid-filled space between them. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae. The inner-most section of the mitochondria is a fluid-filled matrix.\n\nMitochondria are the site of ATP production during aerobic respiration. They are also self-replicating, so more can be made to meet energy denand if the cell requires it. They are abundant in cells where any form of metabolic activity takes place. This includes cells in your liver and synapses.\n\n## Vacuole\nThe vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast and contains fluid. \n\nOnly plant cells have a large permanent vacuole. They are filled with water and various solutes to maintain the stability of the cell - as when they are full they exert force on the cell wall, causes the cell to become turgid. If all the plant cells are turgid, this helps to support non-woody plants.\n\n## Lysosomes\nThese are small bags formed from the Golgi apparatus. Each is enclosed within a single membrane. They contain powerful hydrolytic (digestive) enzymes. They are abundant in immune cells such as phagocytes, neutrophils and macrophages that can ingest and digest invading bacteria. \n\nLysosomes keep the dangerous enzymes seperate from the rest of the cell, preventing damage to organelles. Lysosomes can engulf dead cell organelles and foreign matter and return digested components for reuse. \n\n## Cilia and undulipodia\nThese are protrusions from the cell and are surrounded by the cell surface membrane. Each contains microtubules (see Cytoskeleton for more details). They are formed from centrioles.\n\nThe epitheal cells lining your airways have many hundreds of cilia that beat and move the band of mucus. Nearly all cell types in the body have one cilium that acts as an antenna. It contains receptors and allows cells to detect signals about their immediate environment. The only human cell to have an undulipodium (a lot of cillium) is a spermaozoon. The unulipodium allows the spermatozoon to move.\n\n## Ribosomes\nSmall, spherical and about 20nm in diameter they are constructed from ribosomal RNA. They are made in the nucleolus from two different subunits which pass through the nucelar envelope into the cell cytoplasm and then combine. Some remain free in the cytoplasm and some attach to the RER.\n\nRibosomes bound to the exterior of the RER are mainly for synthesising proteins that will be exported out of the cell. Ribosomes that are free in the cytoplasm - either singularly or in a cluster - are primarily a site for synthesising proteins that will be used in the cell. \n\n## Centrioles\nThe centrioles consist of two bundles of microtubles at right angles to each other. The microtubules are made of tublin protein subunits, and are arranged to form a cylinder.\n\nBefore a cell divides, the spindle, made of threads of tubulin, forms from the centrioles. Chromosomes attach to the middle part of the spindle and motor proteins walk along the tubin threads, pulling the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. Centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and undulipodia:\n\n- Before the cilia form, the centrioles multiply and line up beneath the cell surface membrane.\n- Microtubules then sprout outwards from each centriole, forming a cilium or undulipodium.\n\nCentrioles are usually absent from unicellular green algae.\n\n## Cytoskeleton\nA network of protein structures within the cytoplasm. It consists of:\n\n- rod-like microfilaments made of subunits of the protein actin; they are polymers of actin and each microfilament is about 7nm in diameter.\n- intermmediate filaments about 10nm in diameter.\n- straight, cylindrical microtubules, made of protein subunits called tubulin, about 18-30nm in diameter. \n- The **cytoskeletal motor proteins**, myosins, kinesins and dyeins, are molecular motors. They are also enzymes and have a site that binds to and allows hydrolysis of ATP as their energy source.\n\nThe protein microfilaments within the cytoplasm give support and mechanical strength, keep the cell's shape stable and allow cell movement. They also:\n\n- form the spindle before cell division\n- form a track for motor proteins to walk along\n- make up the cilia, undulipodia and centrioles\n\nAnd intermediate filaments:\n\n- anchor the nucleus to the cytoplasm\n- extend between cells in certain tissues, enabling cell-cell signalling.\n\n## Cellulose cell wall\nThe cell wall of plants is outside the plasma membrane and is constructed from a bundle of cellulose fibres.\n\nThe cell wall is strong and and can prevent plant cells from bursting when turgid. The cell wall:\n\n- provides strength\n- maintain cell shape\n- contribute to strength and support of the whole plant\n- are permeable and allow solutions to pass through\n\nFungi have cell walls that contain chitin, not cellulose.\n\n## Chloroplasts\nThese are large organelles, 4-10¬µm long. They are only present in plants and some protoctists. They are surrounded by a double membrane or envelope. The inner membrane is continuous with flattened membrane sacs called thylakoids. The fluid-filled matrix is called the stroma.\n\nChloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis\nThe first stage of photosynthesis is when light energy is trapped by chlorophyll and used to make ATP. This occurs in the grana. Water is also split to provide hydrogen ions.\nThe second stage when hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide, using energy from ATP to make carbohydrates, occurs in the stroma. \n\nChloroplasts are abundant in leaf cells, particularly the pallisade mesophyll layer.\n\n\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-08T09:41:55.721463208Z","tags":null},"/Sixth-Form/Biology/Cells/Plant-Cells":{"title":"Plant cells","content":"\nSee Chloroplasts, Vacuole and Cell Wall from [Organelles](content/Sixth Form/Biology/Cells/Organelles)\n\n\n\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-08T09:41:55.721463208Z","tags":null},"/Sixth-Form/Business/Units/3.1-What-is-a-business/What-is-a-business":{"title":"What is a business?","content":"\n## Definitions\n\nA business is an organisation that exists to provide goods and services on a commercial basis to customers.\n\nGoods are physical products that can be traded.\n\nServices are intangible products, a task is fulfilled by a business to save someone without the time, expertise or the equipment the effort of sorting it out themselves.\n\n## Benefits to society\n- Sustain economy\n- Creates jobs\n- Increases consumer spending\n- Tax\n- Provide amenities\n- Drives innovation\n- Increased (international) investment\n\n\n[Go home](/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-08T09:41:55.721463208Z","tags":null},"/Sixth-Form/Computer-Science/Programming/Programming-1":{"title":"Programming 1","content":"\nAn algorithm is an unambiguous, repeatable set of instructions that can be followed to complete a given task in a finite time.\n\nProgramming is the process of converting an algorithm into computer code.\n\n## Building Blocks\n\n### Sequence\nA series of instructions that must be completed in order.\n\n### Iteration\nRepeating a sequence zero or more times.\n\n### Decision\nZero or one sequences that can be chosen from a range of options.\n\n\n# Worksheet\n\nAn algorithm is an umabiguous, repeatable set of instructions that can be followed to complete a task in a finite time.

There are 28 pupils in Miss Green's class. She would like to award each pupil a house point. What sort of iteration should be used?\n\nDefinite iteration would make sense, because we know how many pupils are in the class. In terms of programming, we can use a for loop to assign a house point to each pupil before the loop terminates. This allows us to perform a simple logical operation many times without having to write the logic out 28 different times.
