The distinguishing factor between rough and smooth ER is that rough ER is coated with ribosomes.\n\nrER is the cells internal transport system and creates channels that enable the transport of substances from one section of the cell to another. The rER provides a large surface area for ribosomes to attach. The ribosomes assemble proteins from amino acids , these proteins are then absorbed through the membrane and are transported by the rER to the Golgi Apparatus for modification and packaging. \n\n## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (sER/Smooth ER)\nLike the rER, this is a system of membrances within the cell that contain fluid-filled cavities that link to the nuclear envelope. It DOES NOT have ribosomes on its surface.\n\nsER contains enzymes that catalyse reactions involved with the metabolism of lipids. This includes: \n\n- synthesis of cholesterol\n- synthesis of lipids/phospholids needed by the cell\n- synthesis of steroid hormones\n\nIt is involved with the absorption, synthesis and transport of lipids from the gut.\n\n## Golgi Apparatus\nThis consist of a stack of membrane bound flattened sacs. Secretory vesicles bring materials to  and from the Golgi. \n\nProteins are modified here. Examples include:\n\n- adding sugar molecules to make glycoproteins\n- adding lipid molecules to make lipoproteins\n- folding proteins into their 3D shape\n\nThese proteins are then packaged into vesicles that are pinched off and then:\n\n- stored in the cell\n- moved to the plasma membrane, either to be incorporated into the plasma membrane or to be exported out of the cell.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nThese are usually spherical, rod-shaped or branched structures and are typically 2-5Œºm long. They are enclosed in two membranes with a fluid-filled space between them. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae. The inner-most section of the mitochondria is a fluid-filled matrix.\n\nMitochondria are the site of ATP production during aerobic respiration. They are also self-replicating, so more can be made to meet energy denand if the cell requires it. They are abundant in cells where any form of metabolic activity takes place. This includes cells in your liver and synapses.\n\n## Vacuole\nThe vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast and contains fluid. \n\nOnly plant cells have a large permanent vacuole. They are filled with water and various solutes to maintain the stability of the cell - as when they are full they exert force on the cell wall, causes the cell to become turgid. If all the plant cells are turgid, this helps to support non-woody plants.\n\n## Lysosomes\nThese are small bags formed from the Golgi apparatus. Each is enclosed within a single membrane. They contain powerful hydrolytic (digestive) enzymes. They are abundant in immune cells such as phagocytes, neutrophils and macrophages that can ingest and digest invading bacteria. \n\nLysosomes keep the dangerous enzymes seperate from the rest of the cell, preventing damage to organelles. Lysosomes can engulf dead cell organelles and foreign matter and return digested components for reuse. \n\n## Cilia and undulipodia\nThese are protrusions from the cell and are surrounded by the cell surface membrane. Each contains microtubules (see Cytoskeleton for more details). They are formed from centrioles.\n\nThe epitheal cells lining your airways have many hundreds of cilia that beat and move the band of mucus. Nearly all cell types in the body have one cilium that acts as an antenna. It contains receptors and allows cells to detect signals about their immediate environment. The only human cell to have an undulipodium (a lot of cillium) is a spermatozoon. The unulipodium allows the spermatozoon to move.\n\n## Ribosomes\nSmall, spherical and about 20nm in diameter they are constructed from ribosomal RNA. They are made in the nucleolus from two different subunits which pass through the nucelar envelope into the cell cytoplasm and then combine. Some remain free in the cytoplasm and some attach to the rER.\n\nRibosomes bound to the exterior of the rER are mainly for synthesising proteins that will be exported out of the cell. Ribosomes that are free in the cytoplasm - either singularly or in a cluster - are primarily a site for synthesising proteins that will be used in the cell. \n\n## Centrioles\nThe centrioles consist of two bundles of microtubles at right angles to each other. The microtubules are made of tublin protein subunits, and are arranged to form a cylinder.\n\nBefore a cell divides, the spindle, made of threads of tubulin, forms from the centrioles. Chromosomes attach to the middle part of the spindle and motor proteins walk along the tubin threads, pulling the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. Centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and undulipodia:\n\n- Before the cilia form, the centrioles multiply and line up beneath the cell surface membrane.\n- Microtubules then sprout outwards from each centriole, forming a cilium or undulipodium.\n\nCentrioles are usually absent from unicellular green algae.\n\n## Cytoskeleton\nA network of protein structures within the cytoplasm. It consists of:\n\n- rod-like microfilaments made of subunits of the protein actin; they are polymers of actin and each microfilament is about 7nm in diameter.\n- intermmediate filaments about 10nm in diameter.\n- straight, cylindrical microtubules, made of protein subunits called tubulin, about 18-30nm in diameter. \n- The **cytoskeletal motor proteins**, myosins, kinesins and dyeins, are molecular motors. They are also enzymes and have a site that binds to and allows hydrolysis of ATP as their energy source.\n\nThe protein microfilaments within the cytoplasm give support and mechanical strength, keep the cell's shape stable and allow cell movement. They also:\n\n- form the spindle before cell division\n- form a track for motor proteins to walk along\n- make up the cilia, undulipodia and centrioles\n\nAnd intermediate filaments:\n\n- anchor the nucleus to the cytoplasm\n- extend between cells in certain tissues, enabling cell-cell signalling.\n\n## Cellulose cell wall\nThe cell wall of plants is outside the plasma membrane and is constructed from a bundle of cellulose fibres.\n\nThe cell wall is strong and and can prevent plant cells from bursting when turgid. The cell wall:\n\n- provides strength\n- maintain cell shape\n- contribute to strength and support of the whole plant\n- are permeable and allow solutions to pass through\n\nFungi have cell walls that contain chitin, not cellulose.\n\n## Chloroplasts\nThese are large organelles, 4-10¬µm long. They are only present in plants and some protoctists. They are surrounded by a double membrane or envelope. The inner membrane is continuous with flattened membrane sacs called thylakoids. The fluid-filled matrix is called the stroma.\n\nChloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis\nThe first stage of photosynthesis is when light energy is trapped by chlorophyll and used to make ATP. This occurs in the grana. Water is also split to provide hydrogen ions.\nThe second stage when hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide, using energy from ATP to make carbohydrates, occurs in the stroma. \n\nChloroplasts are abundant in leaf cells, particularly the pallisade mesophyll layer.\n\n\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.928008875Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/PlantCells":{"title":"Plant Cells","content":"\nSee Chloroplasts, Vacuole and Cell Wall from [Organelles](sixth/Biology/Cells/Organelles)\n\n\n\n## Worksheet HWK (8 Sep 22)\n\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/2022-09-08-110545.jpg]]\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/2022-09-08-110558.jpg]]\n\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/2022-09-08-110511.jpg]]\n\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/2022-09-08-110457.jpg]]\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.928008875Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/3.1/BusinessObjectives":{"title":"Business Objectives","content":"\n![[sixth/Business/Units/3.1/img/Pasted image 20220914095046.png]]\n*The hierarchy of objectives*\n\n---\n\n\n**SMART** - acronym helps management set effective objectives\n\nS - Specific; the objective should state exactly what is to be achieved.\n\nM - Measureable; an objective should be capable of measurement - so that it is possible to determine success.\n\nA - Achieveable; the objective should be realistic given the circumstances in which it is set.\n\nR - Relevant; objectives should be relevant to the people responsible for achieving them.\n\nT - Time Bound; objectives should be set with a time-frame in mind. These deadlines should be realistic.\n\n\u003e [!success] Business should follow SMART\n\u003e\n\u003e SMART objectives focus the business on what is important, ensuring that they stay on track.\n\n## Strategic vs Tactical objectives\n\nStrategic objectives focus on the long term, and are set by the board.\n\nTactical objectives tend to be more short term, and can be set by line managers.\n\n## Business Aims \u0026 Objectives Activity Worksheet\n\n#### Explain the difference between an aim and an objective\nAn aim is an overall target or goal for the business. Whereas objectives are smaller targets to help reach the aim. A business may have several different objectives to reach a single aim.\n\n#### Why do businesses have aims and objectives?\nThis gives them a purpose and a target to work towards.\n\n#### Describe what financial aims are\nIncreasing sales, revenue or sales. Anything related to directly increasing cashflow.\n\n**Survival**: Common aim for new businesses, simply focuses on keeping things going while they get started.\n\n**Profit**: Simply looking to earn more revenue than the sum of their costs. Increasing profit would allow greater wealth to the the business.\n\n**Sales**: To aim to sell a certain amount of a product, gives employees a common goal.\n\n**Market share**: To increase market share by a set percentage over the course of a year.\n\n**Security**: The entrepreneur being able to withdraw enough to be financially stable.\n\n#### Explain non-financial aims\n\n- Not usually linked to monetary success\n- Might be a solution to a social issue\n- Frequently personal to the founder(s)\n\n**Social**: Aims committing to act ethically. \n\n**Satisfaction**: The aim of turning a passion or a hobby into a business can often be a common start-up aim. \n\n**Challenge**: The challenge of starting something from scratch. Aiming to succeed on your own \u0026 with your own terms.\n\n**Control**: Having control over decisions made, your working pattern and the business direction.\n\n#### Suggest whether you believe non-financial aims are necessary for a profit-making business.\n\nYes, when people are going to give money to a business, they are likely to choose the most ethical option if it is financially viable to them. Therefore, businesses that have non-financial aims will be more inviting to new customers.\n\n#### Do you believe Lush has benefitted from having clear non-financial aims?\nYes, people knowing that no animal testing has occured makes them feel more comfortable when buying products from Lush. Things like this become a selling point and good publicity.\n\n#### Explain the reasons why businesses aims and objectives differ\n\nDifferent markets will have different problems and audiences, looking for different things. And as a business grows, it will need to update it's aims and objectives to remain competitive. It does not make sense for LEGO to aim to reduce animal testing - because they don't test on animals. Lush however has benefitted from that.\n\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.936008969Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/3.1/WhatIsABusiness":{"title":"What Is A Business?","content":"\n## Definitions\n\nA business is an organisation that exists to provide goods and services on a commercial basis to customers.\n\nGoods are physical products that can be traded.\n\nServices are intangible products, a task is fulfilled by a business to save someone without the time, expertise or the equipment the effort of sorting it out themselves.\n\n## Benefits to society\n- Sustain economy\n- Creates jobs\n- Increases consumer spending\n- Tax\n- Provide amenities\n- Drives innovation\n- Increased (international) investment\n\n\nBusiness's begin their corporate life as a startup, more information on startups can be found [here](sixth/Business/Units/3.1/WhatIsAStartUp)\n\n[Go home](/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.936008969Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/3.1/WhatIsAStartUp":{"title":"What Is A Startup?","content":"\n**Key Term:** A start-up is a new business enterprise, formed by one or more entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneur:\n\n- A catalyst for the creation and grwoth of a business\n- fulfill their dreams\n- calculated risk taker\n- organise all the resources\n- find and fill gaps in the market\n\n## Case Study: Olio\n\nAn app that deals with improving waste management in the modern world. \n\n- Part of the solution\n- about carbon footprint, ethics, net 0, level target\n- app - tackle waste by connecting neighbours\n- 30,000+ volunteers\n- Food in 21 minutes (people can send and receive food for free within this time)\n- Nonfood less than 2 hours (same as food, but for shampoo etc etc)\n- Founded by Tessa Clarke\n\n\nAims:\n\n- improve the app\n- B-B proposition\n- international expansion\n- 1 billion user by 2030 \n\nInvolving restaurants, supermarkets, food distributors to reach net 0 waste\n\n\n- 6 million users\n- Their aim is for their customers to be part of the solution, and not just contribute, as to make the system a whole lot stronger and to bring about awareness of food waste.\n\n**Key Term:** A mission is a qualitative statement of the business aims.\n\n**Key Term:** An aim is a long term plan from which objectives are derived.\n\n**Key Term:** An objective is a target which must be achieved in order to realise the stated aim.

(9m)\n\nJayne has received instructions from her superiors and has made a decision to remedy the situation. However, when interacting with her employees, whilst she does listen to feedback she does not take it on board. To make this work, she likely has to compromise with her subordinates to keep morale up. This places Jayne on the **Task Manager** corner of the Blake Mouton Grid - giving her a significant focus on achieving goals above anything else. Jayne does not adapt her plans based on the requests of her employees. She is told that some staff may not be happy with travelling long distances (such as Scotland to London) for various reasons, including them being parents of young children. Whilst she does justify her decision as helping to prevent redundancies - she does not adapt it.\n\nIn a similar sense, she falls under the authoritarian segment of the tannenbaum schmidt continuum. This is because she has centralised the decision making process, and is giving very little control to the people who her decision will impact. \n\nThis does not make Jayne a bad manager, however it does mean people may not feel comfortable around her or taking their problems to her. But at the end of the day, Jayne is not trying to create a Paternalistic environment, all she is focused on is the results. If she can get good results, then her subordinates keep their jobs and everyone can be happy. Because of this, Jayne could be seen as a good manager, but one that works employees hard.\n\n\n## To what extent might a change in Jayne's leadership style improve sales volume? (16m)\n\nUnder her current style, she will be suppressing the creativity of her employees. This is because they will feel like they just have to follow her orders and do everything to the letter. As they are working in the sales team, creative freedom will allow for new ideas to come to fruition and will allow all 25 members of staff to benefit the team at a higher level. However, on the flip side, moving to a different model, such as the democratic one, would have other effects than increasing the diversity of ideas. Some people may be less productive with more freedom, and some of the ideas that the team comes up with may not work out. Luckily, with a greater range of ideas the team is more likely to have a few good ones - whereas previously they would have been stuck with trying to make a single idea work.\n\nIf Jayne were to take this to an extreme and take a more Laissez-faire approach to leadership, she would be taking a much higher risk, but also possibly looking at a much higher potential reward. As long as the team she is managing consists of skilled people whom are capable of working well indepndently from each other, then she should be able to increase productivity by taking a backseat on some of the decision making. \n\nDespite all the potential positives of a more relaxed management style, her current approach with her new plan may be just as, if not more, successful. Jayne is a good sales person, who has been promoted to her position for a reason - and therefore the company has trusted her to do a good job. Whilst sales have decreased since last year, this may not be reflective of sales efforts and simply due to an increasingly digital world. Jayne does have a plan, and as long as she can ensure her team executes it effectively - it should have some success. \n\nIn conclusion, Jayne may be perfectly fine where things are - and would be taking the least risk by changing nothing. However, moving towards greater employee freedom may be incredibly beneficial and boost productivity more than Jayne could manage under her authoritarian style. The problem with a new approach is that the outcome is unknown - so the risk is high.\n\n\n## Leadership Styles Research\n\n**McDonald's**: They have an effective leadership style, because staff working there are typically low skilled. So they delegate from a business manager to a general manager, and then down to shift managers who give instructions to the crew members. As you move higher up the ladder, it becomes less authoritarian as a higher skill level is assumed. This does cause some issues, but most of them are minor and can be easily resolved.\n\n**Nando's**: Managers are reportedly very imposing and stressed. They are not paid much more than the lowest level workers, but are given a lot more responsibility and are expected to run everything. This results in the managers not caring much for the business or their work and results in a more impoverished management style. Becuase of this there are employees who do not feel satisfied with the Nando's management style.\n\nA significant amount of data for this research was found on [Breakroom](https://breakroom.cc)\n\n[Go home](/)","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.936008969Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/3.2/LeadershipOrManagement":{"title":"Leadership or Management?","content":"\n**Leaders**: Inspire people, build relationships, take risks and have followers.\n\n**Managers**: Enact the plan, use their authority, manage risks, have subordinates\n\nBoth are closely linked and one person may have to do both roles.\n\n\u003e Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things - **Peter Drucker**\n\n## Traditional Levels of Management\n\n**Senior Management:** \n- Board of Directors\n- Set corporate objectives and strategic direction\n- Board is responsible for shareholders; led by the CEO\n\n**Middle Management:**\n- Accountable to senior management\n- Run business functions and departments\n\n**Junior Management:**\n- Supervisory role, accountable to middle management\n- Monitor and control day-to-day tasks, and manage teams of workers\n\n### Moving away from Autocratic Styles\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\n- Changes in society's values\n- Better educated workforce\n- Focus on need for soft HR skills\n- Changing workplace organisation\n- Greater workplace legislation\n- Pressure for greater employee involvement\n\n## Blake Mouton Managerial Grid\n\n![[sixth/Business/Units/3.2/img/Pasted image 20220913095215.png]]\n\nThe \"*Blake Mouton Managerial Grid*\" shows how management styles differ between the balance between a concern for people and concern for results.\n\nProduce or Perish Management is also called Task Management.\n\n### Impoverished Management\n\nLaissez-faire style; minimal effort on management; looking to avoid blame for errors. \n\nLow concern for people and task\n\n### Country Club Management\nFocus on creating safe, comfortable working environment with minimal conflict.\n\nHigh concern for people, low concern for task\n\n### Task Management\nAutocratic style, consistent with McGregor Theory X.

The idea of a constant is to define a reused value once at one point in the code, and then allow for it to be used everywhere. if you want to change the speed of the player in your game, you can change the constant at first definition, avoiding a huge amount of refactoring.\n\n\u003e [!bug] Python does not support constants natively\n\u003e\n\u003e Instead, use a fully capitalised variable name and do not change it. This method is flawed, but it's the best one avaliable.\n \n\n`SPEED = 5.0`\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908115902.png]]\n\nThe next page is [subroutines](sixth/CompSci/Programming/Subroutines)\n\n\n[Go home](/)\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-14T11:24:00.936008969Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/Modules":{"title":"Modules","content":"\n## Importing a module\n\nUsing the `import` keyword, you can bring a module into your code.

These allow for increased modularity in an application. It also makes it much easier to work on a project with multiple people involved because they can each write subroutines to work together and produce a complex system quickly.\n\nIt is much easier to solve a problem by breaking it down into subroutines.\n\nAll subroutines are reusable, meaning that if you write a utility to authenticate a user, you can call the same subroutine from multiple places, keeping code tidy and reducing time wasting.\n\nHere is an example subroutine written in Python:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(1,2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will return the literal `3`. This is because we pass the values `1` and `2` to the subroutine, which then adds them together. The answer is printed out because we save the result in a variable and then display it with the `print` command.\n\nHere is a demonstration of the program being executed:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908123946.png]]\n\nTaking this a step further, we could ask the user to pick the values to add together. We would do this using the following code:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# This could be more efficient, and will crash if we enter an invalid input.\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter num1: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter num2: \"))\n\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(num1,num2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nAnd the result looks like this when we run it:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908124522.png]]\n\n## Types of subroutine\n\n\u003e [!abstract] In terms of Python\n\u003e\n\u003e The following uses Python keywords as examples, but the same logic can be applied to any language.\n\nBecause this code uses the `return` keyword, it is a **function**.\n\nThe other type of subroutine is a **procedure**, this would not use the `return` keyword.\n\nA procedure does not return any value to the logic that called it, whereas a function does. This is the only difference between the two types.\n\nA function would typically be used where a response is needed or the status of the action needs verifying. If you do not need an answer, then a procedure may be the best choice.\n\nSubroutines are made out of the basic [building blocks](sixth/CompSci/Programming/BuildingBlocks) found here.\n\n## Task: Write a subroutine\n\nA procedure that:\n- Receive a person's name\n- Adds \"from PHHS\" to the name\n- Prints the product\n- Ends\n\n```py\ndef FromPHHS(name):\n\tprint(name+\" from PHHS\")\n```\n\nNext, a function to convert celsius to fahrenheit:\n\n```py\ndef CelToFaren(celsius):\n\tfahren = celsius * 1.8 + 32\n\treturn fahren\n```\n\n\u003e [!info] Identifiers\n\u003e\n\u003eJust like with variables, the name of a subroutine is officially called an identifier. Also - just like with variables - the identifier should be descriptive as it improves code readability.\n\nTo extend the functionality of a subroutine (or any of your code), modules are very useful.

It can be used as a [literal](sixth/CompSci/Programming/LiteralsVariablesConstants) or stored in a variable.\n\nExamples:\n\n- 45\n- \"Liam\"\n- True\n- 64.52\n- [\"apple\", \"kiwi\", \"pear\"]\n\nVariables can *only* contain values. So if it is contained within a variable - it is a value.\n\n---\n## Expression\nAn **expression** is an operation of values and/or variables that will result in a value.\n\nTypically, you get a different value output than the input - as you are performing a mathematical operation usually (and most of the time you won't  be doing a * 1 operation).\n\nExamples:\n\n- 32 * 4\n- 15 - 2\n- 43 / 7\n- 3 == 5\n- \"hello\" + \"world\"\n- 4 \u003e 2\n- \"hello\" * 4\n- input(\"What is your name? \") * 6\n- ((12 * 6) /4 ) + 8\n\nExpressions are used to modify or compare values. They may contain a function call (ie, `int(3.4) * 5` is still an expression).\n\nData Types do matter in expressions - so whilst you can multiply a string by an integer, you cannot divide a string by an integer.\n\nSo `Bob * 4` is valid and results in \"BobBobBobBob\"\n\nBut `Bob / 2` is not valid and will return an error.\n\nA division operation will **always** return a float - even if the inputs were integers.\n\n---\n## Statement\nA **statement** is any valid fragment of code. (A command, any line of code etc).\n\nExamples:\n\n- print(\"Hello world\")\n- import random\n- 25 == 30\n- if int(age) == 30:\n\n\n\n\n---\n\u003e [!question] Multiple types \n\u003e\n\u003eSomething can be or contain multiple types.
